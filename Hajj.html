<h3 class="backcolor">Hajj</h3>
<p>SHajj: Hajj is the pilgrimage to the holy city (Mecca). Every adult Muslim must make this trip once in their lifetime. The steps to Hajj are:  </p>
<ol>
<u><i><li>Mina</li></i></u>
<p>After arriving in Mecca, on day one pilgrims leave the city and head to an area called Mina where they spend the rest of the day in prayer.</p>
<u><i><li>Arafat</li></i></u>
<p>On the Day of Arafat, pilgrims spend the entire day on, or near, a hill known as Mount Arafat or the Mount of Mercy.</p>
<u><i><li>Muzdalifa</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrims spend a night in an area called Muzdalifa, which is part way between Arafat and Mina.</p>
<u><i><li>Jamarat</li></i></u>
<p> Jamarat is a ritual of stoning of the devil. Three pillars - small, medium and large - are stoned by pilgrims with the pebbles they collected on their way from Muzdalifa the night before.</p>
<u><i><li>Eid</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrams return  to Mina to celebrate Eid.</p>
<u><i><li>Farewell tawaf</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrims return to Mecca for the final tawaf which is the circling of the Kaaba</p>
</ol>
<u><h4>What are the imprtances of all the pillars?</h4></u>
