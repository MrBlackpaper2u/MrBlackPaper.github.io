<h3>Shahada</h3>
<p>Shahada: “La ilaha ill Allah, Muhammadur Rasool Allah.” The shahada is the testimony of faith to Allah. The meaning of the shahada is “There is no true god but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger. If you are a non-muslim and you want to convert to Islam all you have to do is say the shahada and believe that it’s true. To convert you also have to understand that god (Allah) has no partners or son. The Shahada is the most important part of converting to Islam and being a Muslim.</p>

<h3>Salah</h3>
<p>Salah: Muslims have to perform five prayers a day. These prayers are when we are closest to God (Allah). During prayer, you must be facing Qibla which is the direction of the Kabaah. On Fridays, just after noon, you can pray salat al-Jum'ah where it is only two raquas and there is also a khutbah added with it.</p>

<h3>Zakat</h3>
<p>Zakat:  Zakat is a   tax on Muslims where you have to give up some of the money you earn to give to the poor or the people in need. </p>

<h3>Sawm</h3>
<p>Sawm: Is fasting on any day but particularly the month of Ramadan (The holy month). Ramadan is a month on the Muslim calendar where you cannot eat or drink from sunrise to sunset and repeating this throughout the whole month.</p>


<h3>Hajj</h3>
<p>SHajj: Hajj is the pilgrimage to the holy city (Mecca). Every adult Muslim must make this trip once in their lifetime. The steps to Hajj are:  </p>

<ol>
<u><i><li>Mina</li></i></u>
<p>After arriving in Mecca, on day one pilgrims leave the city and head to an area called Mina where they spend the rest of the day in prayer.</p>
<u><i><li>Arafat</li></i></u>
<p>On the Day of Arafat, pilgrims spend the entire day on, or near, a hill known as Mount Arafat or the Mount of Mercy.</p>
<u><i><li>Muzdalifa</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrims spend a night in an area called Muzdalifa, which is part way between Arafat and Mina.</p>
<u><i><li>Jamarat</li></i></u>
<p> Jamarat is a ritual of stoning of the devil. Three pillars - small, medium and large - are stoned by pilgrims with the pebbles they collected on their way from Muzdalifa the night before.</p>
<u><i><li>Eid</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrams return  to Mina to celebrate Eid.</p>
<u><i><li>Farewell tawaf</li></i></u>
<p>Pilgrims return to Mecca for the final tawaf which is the circling of the Kaaba</p>
</ol>
