<h3 class="backcolor">Salah</h3>
<p>Salah: Muslims have to perform five prayers a day. These prayers are when we are closest to God (Allah). During prayer, you must be facing Qibla which is the direction of the Kabaah. On Fridays, just after noon, you can pray salat al-Jum'ah where it is only two raquas and there is also a khutbah added with it.</p>
